# Graph Algorithms (Coming Soon)

This directory will contain implementations of fundamental graph algorithms including traversal, shortest path, and minimum spanning tree algorithms.

## Planned Algorithms

### Graph Traversal
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explore graph level by level
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explore graph by going as deep as possible

### Shortest Path Algorithms
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Single-source shortest paths with non-negative weights
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Single-source shortest paths with negative weights
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: All-pairs shortest paths

### Minimum Spanning Tree
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: MST using union-find data structure
- **Prim's Algorithm**: MST using priority queue

### Topological Sorting
- **Kahn's Algorithm**: Topological sort using in-degree counting
- **DFS-based**: Topological sort using depth-first search

### Network Flow
- **Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm**: Maximum flow in flow networks
- **Edmonds-Karp Algorithm**: Maximum flow using BFS

## Graph Representations

- **Adjacency Matrix**: 2D array representation
- **Adjacency List**: Array of lists representation
- **Edge List**: List of edges representation

## Applications

- **Social Networks**: Friend recommendations, community detection
- **Transportation**: Route planning, traffic optimization
- **Computer Networks**: Routing protocols, network analysis
- **Web Crawling**: Page ranking, link analysis
- **Scheduling**: Task dependencies, resource allocation
