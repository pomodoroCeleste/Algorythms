# Disjoint Set Data Structure (Coming Soon)

This directory will contain implementations of the Disjoint Set (Union-Find) data structure, which efficiently maintains a collection of disjoint sets and supports union and find operations.

## Planned Operations

### [MakeSet](MakeSet/)
- **Description**: Create a new set containing a single element
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
- **Usage**: Initialize disjoint sets

### [FindSet](FindSet/)
- **Description**: Find the representative (root) of the set containing an element
- **Time Complexity**: O(α(n)) with path compression
- **Usage**: Determine which set an element belongs to

### [Union](Union/)
- **Description**: Merge two sets into a single set
- **Time Complexity**: O(α(n)) with union by rank
- **Usage**: Connect components or merge groups

## Optimizations

### Path Compression
- **Technique**: Make every node point directly to the root during FindSet
- **Effect**: Flattens the tree structure for faster future operations
- **Result**: Amortized nearly constant time complexity

### Union by Rank
- **Technique**: Always attach the smaller tree under the root of the larger tree
- **Effect**: Keeps trees balanced and prevents degeneration
- **Result**: Maintains logarithmic height bounds

### Union by Size
- **Alternative**: Union based on the number of elements in each set
- **Effect**: Similar to union by rank but tracks set sizes
- **Usage**: When size information is needed

## Applications

### Graph Algorithms
- **Kruskal's MST Algorithm**: Detect cycles while building minimum spanning tree
- **Connected Components**: Find connected components in undirected graphs

### Dynamic Connectivity
- **Network Connectivity**: Determine if two nodes are connected
- **Percolation**: Model fluid flow through porous materials

### Image Processing
- **Connected Component Labeling**: Group connected pixels
- **Region Growing**: Segment images based on similarity

### Computational Geometry
- **Convex Hull**: Efficiently compute convex hulls
- **Delaunay Triangulation**: Maintain triangulation properties

## Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Naive | With Optimizations |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| MakeSet | O(1) | O(1) |
| FindSet | O(n) | O(α(n)) |
| Union | O(n) | O(α(n)) |

Where α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function, which is effectively constant for all practical purposes.

## Implementation Variants

### Array-Based
- **Storage**: Use arrays to store parent and rank information
- **Pros**: Simple implementation, cache-friendly
- **Cons**: Fixed size, requires integer element mapping

### Node-Based
- **Storage**: Each element is a node with parent pointer
- **Pros**: Dynamic size, works with any element type
- **Cons**: Extra memory for pointers
